    "1) Place Gopigo3 at start of maze\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Run Code to execute movement through maze\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Gopigo3 must be near specific start location for optimal results. The floor the maze was built on is not leveled. The floor has a slight dip at the beginning and also there is carpet underneath the maze. Door mats were added to even out the level difference. This helped the gopigo3 be mobile but there was still many challenges. The gopigo3 can only go forward, turn left at 90 degrees, and turn right at 90 degrees. Since the Gopigo3 is programmed to make 90 degree turns on an uneven surface, gopigo3's trajectory is very sensitive to its starting location."

    "\n",
    "**Instructions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A boolean variable is initialized to true\n",
    "\n",
    "2) A list to store the distances of objects detected left and right is created\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Initialized an int variable, moves, to run the script for a certain amount for testing purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "4) While loop executes all functions under conditional statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "5) If statement instructs GoPiGo to go forward until it detects and object less than 115 mm away. \n",
    "\n",
    "6) The GoPiGo will stop and the GoPiGo will turn left 30 degrees. The turn is to help the GoPiGo detect objects on it's left better. Since it cannot turn as far left as it can right. The servo will then rotate to 180 degrees and sleep for one second. Then it will record the distance from the nearest object. The distance will be appeneded to the dist_vals list.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) The GoPiGo will then turn back 30 degrees to the right, its' initial position. The servo will rotate to the 20 degrees position. It then will record the nearest object and append the value to the dist_vals list.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) If/else statements are placed to determine which direction to take. If the distance measured from the left, dist_vals[0], is less than distance measured from the right, dist_vals[1], GoPiGo will turn left. If vice verse GoPiGo will turn right. Note: In the case if values are the same the GoPiGo will turn right.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) Values from list are cleared after choosing left or right.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) GoPiGo repeats until moves is greater than 12. Note: From prior testing of the script it was shown that the GoPiGo could get out the maze in 12 moves. Would like to implement a different way to indicate the GoPiGo was out of the maze but because of time constraints this is the best I could do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional: Distance measurements while the GoPiGo is moving is printed underneath the block. The values from when the GoPiGo stops and measures each side is printed in a list format ex: [#,#]. It also indicates which direction was taken after the measurements where stored. "
